# GameCraft-clang Dev Container Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the GameCraft-clang Dev Container project! This project is an exciting journey into the world of game development using the C language, tailored specifically for educational purposes. Developed by JuniorIT.AI, GameCraft-clang is a Pure C SDL2 game engine that harnesses the simplicity of C and the concepts of object-oriented programming, akin to C++. 

## Why GameCraft-clang?

GameCraft-clang is uniquely designed to teach the fundamentals of C language through the engaging process of game development. By diving into this project, you'll not only grasp the basics of C but also gain insights into how C++ operates, all within the context of a game engine. This approach offers a dual advantage â€“ understanding core programming concepts and applying them in a practical, enjoyable way.

### Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Programming in C:** GameCraft-clang demonstrates how object-oriented principles can be implemented in C, providing a bridge to understanding C++.
- **Hands-On Learning:** Develop a game from scratch, reinforcing your learning through real-world application.
- **Insights into Game Engine Mechanics:** Discover the inner workings of game engines, an essential skill for any aspiring game developer.
